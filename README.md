## basic trading algorithm to get my feet wet with python

    just as the heading suggests, this is my first time working with python, 
    the whole reason i wanted to learn how to code was because I wanted a trading bot
    so that i don't have to stay up all night watching charts move (super time consuming) 
    my main goal here is to use this algo to make some trades when the market allows, 
    but also to store price data into a database so that I can start building a dataset to work with 
    
### some things i want to add in future versions:
        
        
        - machine learning
        
            I've been interested in machine learning as of late so I figure this would be a great way to learn more
            
        - a website/app
        
            somewhere even the least technical savvy people could setup an account and get some sloa and steady income
            figured this would be a good way to put my web development knowledge to use as well
